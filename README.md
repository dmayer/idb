# idb

idb is a tool to simplify some common tasks for iOS pentesting and research. It is still a work in progress but already provides a bunch of (hopefully) useful commands. The goal was to provide all (or most) functionality for both, iDevices and the iOS simulator. For this, a lot is abstracted internally to make it work transparently for both environments. Below is a a link to the [getting started guide](//github.com/dmayer/idb/wiki/Getting-started) and also a [full command reference](//github.com/dmayer/idb/wiki/Idb-command-reference). Bug reports, feature requests, and contributions are more than welcome!
